## Decision Making Process

### Consensus Required

Both maintainers must agree on:

### Individual Authority

Each maintainer can independently:

- Merge small bug fixes and improvements
- Respond to issues and community questions
- Create and assign issues
- Update documentation

### Conflict Resolution

When we disagree:

1. **Discussion**: Extended discussion to understand perspectives
2. **Research**: Gather community input if needed
3. **Compromise**: Find middle ground or alternative solution
4. **Escalation**: If needed, seek input from trusted community members
5. **Temporary Decision**: If urgent, implement temporary solution with plan to revisit

## Communication

### Community Communication

- **Issues**: Bug reports and feature requests
- **Discussions**: General project discussion
- **Pull Requests**: Code contributions
- **Email**: <info@mlabs.city> for private matters

## Contribution Guidelines

### Community Contributions

1. **Small Changes**: Single maintainer approval required

- Security issues: Within 24 hours (one of us)
- Urgent bugs: Within 24-48 hours
- General issues: Within 3-5 days
- Pull requests: Within 1 week
- Community discussions: Within 1 week

## Release Process

1. **Planning**: Decide features and timeline together
